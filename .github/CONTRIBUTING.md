## üìù Commit Guidelines

To keep a clean and consistent Git history, please follow these conventions when writing commit messages.

### 1. Basic Syntax

```
git commit -m "<type>: <short description>"
```

Each commit message should clearly explain what and why a change was made. Before committing, ask yourself:
- Why have I made these changes?
- What effect have my changes made?
- Why was the change needed?
- What are the changes in reference to?

### 2. Conventional Commit Format
Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
standard:
```
<type>: <description>
```

#### The commit type can include the following:

| Type       | Meaning                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | Introduces a new feature                                |
| `fix`      | Fixes a bug                                             |
| `docs`     | Documentation updates (e.g. README, CONTRIBUTING)       |
| `style`    | Code style or formatting changes (no code logic impact) |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring that doesn‚Äôt change functionality    |
| `test`     | Adds or updates tests                                   |
| `chore`    | Routine tasks, maintenance, or dependency updates       |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements                                |
| `ci`       | Continuous integration or build pipeline changes        |
| `build`    | Changes to the build system or external dependencies    |
| `revert`   | Reverts a previous commit                               |


### 3. Writing High-Quality Commit Messages

Follow these best practices:

- Use the imperative mood
  - ‚úÖ "add dark mode toggle"
  - ‚ùå "added dark mode toggle‚Äù or ‚Äúadds dark mode toggle"

- Capitalize the first word of type and description, but do not end with punctuation
  - ‚úÖ "fix: resolve UI glitch on mobile"
  - ‚ùå "Fix: Resolve UI glitch on mobile."
- Template for commit message:
  - Keep it concise:
    - Subject line ‚â§ 50 characters
    - Body lines ‚â§ 72 characters 
  - Explain the context (if needed)
  - **Avoid filler words:**
    - Be direct, skip words like "maybe", "I think", or "kind of".
Add a body when the commit isn‚Äôt self-explanatory:

```
<short description>
feat: add caching layer for user data
<detail description>
- The new caching system reduces database load by ~30%.
- It uses Redis for fast in-memory lookups.
```






## 2. Branch Naming Convention

### C√∫ ph√°p:
```
<type>/<short-description>
```

### C√°c `type` ph·ªï bi·∫øn
- `feature/` ‚Üí ph√°t tri·ªÉn t√≠nh nƒÉng m·ªõi
- `bugfix/` ‚Üí s·ª≠a bug
- `hotfix/` ‚Üí s·ª≠a bug kh·∫©n c·∫•p tr√™n production
- `release/` ‚Üí chu·∫©n b·ªã b·∫£n ph√°t h√†nh
- `chore/` ‚Üí task ph·ª• (CI/CD, config‚Ä¶)

### V√≠ d·ª•
```
feature/login-google
bugfix/cart-empty-error
hotfix/payment-crash
release/v1.2.0
chore/update-dependencies
feature/user-profile-management
bugfix/responsive-layout-mobile
```

# Commit message comparision

## 4. Workflow Recommendations

1. T·∫°o branch t·ª´ `develop`: `git checkout -b feature/t√™n-t√≠nh-nƒÉng`
2. Develop v√† commit theo convention
3. Push v√† t·∫°o PR v√†o `develop`
4. Request review t·ª´ team members
5. Merge sau khi ƒë∆∞·ª£c approve

### Hotfix Process
1. T·∫°o branch t·ª´ `main`: `git checkout -b hotfix/t√™n-bug`

3. T·∫°o PR v√†o c·∫£ `main` v√† `develop`
4. Deploy ngay sau khi merge v√†o `main`

### Release Process
1. T·∫°o `release/v1.x.x` t·ª´ `develop`
2. Final testing v√† bug fixes
3. Merge v√†o `main` v√† tag version
